This is taking into consideration of efficiency and to maximise the use of our time.\n",

As long as there are 2 Outgoing and Incoming Exco members represented by all clubs at all times, that's sufficient. Preferably both Exco members are from the incoming Exco so that they are able to choose their incoming MC members. This is a crucial factor for them as they'll be working together with our incoming MC for 2025.\n",
